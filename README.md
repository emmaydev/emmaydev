Hellow, I’m @Emmay
</h3>

I try to build lean, fast, and reliable systems using tools like Astro + Node, Turso, and Linux. 
I aim to work favoring performance, simplicity, and automation whenever possible. 
My projects are usually minimalist and I mostly try to make the kind of tools and apps I’d actually want to use myself.

[Emmay.com.br](https://emmay.com.br/) is my personal blog where I post my study and projects notes. I would appreciate if you took a look at it.    

I use arch, btw. 

Send an email, if you want to talk :)
